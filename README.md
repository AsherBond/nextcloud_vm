Nextcloud VM Appliance
============

Server installation. Simplified. :cloud:
--------------------------------

#### Interactive Guidance
> **The Nextcloud VM** — _(aka **N**ext**c**loud **V**irtual **M**achine_ or _**NcVM**)_ — helps you create a personal or corporate [Nextcloud Server] _faster_ and _easier._ Fundamentally, NcVM is a carefully crafted _family_ of [\*nix] scripts which interactively guide you through a quality-controlled installation to obtain an [A+ security-rated] Nextcloud instance.

#### Curated Extras
> The Nextcloud [app store] extends core features by allowing you to enable a multitude of free one-click apps. However, _integration apps_ there like [Collabora Online] and [ONLYOFFICE] are solely _bridges_ to Nextcloud. You’re still required to install those services _separately_, which can be complex. NcVM provides optional _**full installation of select curated apps**_, including those and others. Monitor and manage your cloud using any web browser with NcVM’s hand-picked collection of power utilities featuring stunning, modern UIs.

#### All Systems Go
> NcVM can check for and install _stable_ updates to keep things current, smooth, and secure.
